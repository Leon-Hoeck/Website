# Projects and Machine Setup in the Workshop

Welcome to a tour of the workshop I use! I'm excited to share both the machines that make everything possible and some of the interesting projects I've created. Let's dive into the world of digital fabrication and creative engineering.

## Machine Setup

### Laser Cutting

The heart of the laser cutting operations is the Epilog Legend 36EXT. This powerful machine allows for working on various materials with high precision. The large work area of 36 inches provides the flexibility to tackle both small detailed projects and larger pieces.

### 3D Printing Setup

The 3D printing setup consists of several machines, each serving a specific purpose:

The CraftBot Flow IDEX with its dual independent extruders allows for multi-material and multi-color printing.

![Formlabs Form 3](/Images/Projekte+Maschinen/Formlabs%203%20closeup.jpg)
The Formlabs Form 3 SLA printer for high-resolution resin prints.

#### Post-Processing Stations

For post-processing resin prints, the workshop is equipped with both Formlabs and Anycubic wash and cure stations, ensuring professional-quality finished pieces.

### CNC Machining

The CNC setup enables precise machining of various materials, perfect for creating custom parts and prototypes.

## Creative Projects

### 3-Part Puzzle Cube

One of my favorite projects is this 3-part interlocking cube puzzle. It's a great example of precision manufacturing where each piece needs to be perfectly made to fit together. The design challenges both the maker and the solver!

### Elastic Band Ball Project

This elastic band ball project demonstrates the intersection of geometric design and practical assembly, creating an interesting and dynamic object.

## Future Projects

I'm constantly working on new projects and exploring the capabilities of these machines. Each piece of equipment opens up new possibilities for creation and innovation. Stay tuned for more projects and detailed guides on how they're made!
